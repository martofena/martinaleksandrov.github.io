												<span class="image featured"><img src="images/topic1.jpg" alt="© Eranus Telebus Zentrale OHG" height="600"></span>	
												
												<b>Topic description</b>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">
													Eranus Telebus Berlin (https://www.eranus-telebus-zentrale-berlin.com/) promotes transportation services to people
													with mobility hardships. The project focuses on optimizing such services 
													for patients with different levels of emergency between home and hospital locations 
													in Berlin, accounting for emergency preferences such as how long time patients 
													would like to wait for the arrival of ambulances and by what time patients would 
													like to arrive at hospitals, as well as availability constraints such as respecting 
													ambulance capacities, driver shifts, and hospital capacities.
												</p>
												<b>Research question</b>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">
													How can we optimize the transportation of home patients to hospital locations 
													using ambulances while respecting emergency preferences and availability constraints?

												<span class="image featured"><img src="images/banner.jpg" alt=""></span>	
												
												<b>Topic description</b>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">
													Saubermacher, Nordsense, Sensoneo, and Mr.FILL use Internet-of-Things Sensors for 
													detecting the level of garbage in containers across industrial markets such as 
													construction sites and concert events. The project focuses on transferring this idea 
													to household markets in Berlin and other German cities for the on-demand collection 
													of garbage from residential areas. This requires predicting the garbage level and 
													scheduling the collection trucks dynamically, subject to balancing the associated 
													workload of collection teams and reducing the associated carbon footprint of trucks. 
												</p>
												<b>Research question</b>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">
													How can we dynamically predict the level of garbage and schedule the garbage trucks 
													for collecting this garbage while balancing the workload of collectors and reducing
													the carbon footprint?

												<span class="image featured"><img src="images/banner.jpg" alt=""></span>	
												
												<b>Topic description</b>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">
													The bush wildfires in Australia in 2019-2020 damaged nearly 60-84 million acres of farmland, 
													left approximately 3 500 people without homes, and impacted more than 3 billion animal lives. 
													Fire departments often struggle to re-allocate their firefighters properly due to the 
													low visibility from the ground and the limited budget for helicopters. 
													The project investigates the deployment of drones for improving the allocation of
													firefighters dynamically by extending their visibility and, thus, navigating them toward 
													areas of greatest risk.
												</p>
												<b>Research question</b>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">
													How can we deploy the minimum number of drones for maximizing area coverage and informe the
													allocation of firefighters by estimating the risk imposed by wildfires while respecting 
													the available budget?

												<b>Topic description</b>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">
													2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami took more than 230 000 human lives. Minimizing the response

													to locations affected by disasters, subject to accessibility of locations and capacities of 
													vehicles.
												</p>

												<span class="image featured"><img src="images/banner.jpg" alt=""></span>	
												
												<b>Topic description</b>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">
													Mobility is not gender-neutral because women travel more often and use more
													modes of travel than men in their daily routines. As a result, women are more vulnerable
													to sexual assaults in public transport than men which forces them to use alternative
													means of travel such as booking taxis more often. The project investigates optimizing
													the matching between taxi drivers and taxi passengers, subject to two-layer driver 
													preferences for trip profitability and route popularity, as well as two-layer passenger 
													preferences for trip fare and service satisfaction.
												</p>

												<b>Topic description</b>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">
													Ride-sharing has the potential to help us achieve the goals of the European Green Deal by
													promoting strategies for say shared commuting such as the adoption of 2+ road lanes
													implemented say by Navitel Israel. For example, it is estimated that around 90 000 people use 
													their private cars for daily commuting in Berlin. Sharing those cars would deliver a
													significant reduction in the carbon footprint associated with them. The project studies
													maximizing the number of people sharing rides, subject to limiting the individual 
													cost and time for sharing rides.

												<span class="image featured"><img src="images/banner.jpg" alt=""></span>	
												
												<b>Topic description</b>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">
													More than 20 000 whales are killed every year as a result of ship transportation near 
													their migration paths. The project focuses on designing routes
													for ships, subject to avoiding the migration paths of whales and, thus, minimizing the 
													potential danger ships could cause to them. This involves the frequent monitoring of 
													whale locations and possible re-routing of the original paths of the ships. 
													Additional factors that play a role in the design require meeting the shipping deadline 
													for the cargo and respecting the available capacities of the docks.
												</p>

												<b>Topic description</b>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">
													Microtransit services are on-demand shuttle services that facilitate access 
													to public transport for residents in detached areas. The project aims at 
													modeling the preferences of commuters in Berlin for Microtransit services such 
													as BVG Muva and Berlkönig. Such preferences could relate to how much time cummuters would 
													like to walk at most to Microtransit stops, how much money they could pay for 
													the service, and how many accompanying persons they want to use the service with. 
													These could inform the existing services about the construction of new stops and 
													the need for more drivers.  
												</p>
												<b>Research question</b>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">
													How can we evaluate the commuting demand for Microtransit services in the Berlin area while preserving
