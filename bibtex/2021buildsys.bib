abstract = {We consider a model for intelligent household waste collection that is driven by real-time data about the levels of waste in garbage containers. By using such data, we first study deciding which garbage containers can be scheduled for waste collections. We then minimise the number of garbage trucks that could be assigned to locations of containers that are scheduled for waste collections. Finally, we analyse fair allocations of waste costs to households.},
