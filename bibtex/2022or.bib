abstract="We consider routing problems where agents have preferences over pickup and delivery travel options. We look at the class of mechanisms that maximise social welfare. We study computing outcomes with such mechanisms. We also show that agents can manipulate such mechanisms. In response, we study computing pure Nash equilibria induced by such mechanisms. Finally, we analyse the price of anarchy for such mechanisms, which quantifies the welfare loss in an equilibrium.",
