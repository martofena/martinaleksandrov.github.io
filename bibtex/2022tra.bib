abstract = {We consider intelligent household garbage management, where garbage containers are assumed to be digitalized with Internet-of-Things sensors that are capable of sensing the fill levels of containers and transmitting this data through LoRaWAN networks to a central server. We propose that the management is driven by these real-time signals. Thus, we give a number of algorithms for it. We give two algorithms that decide which containers can be scheduled for collections. Also, we give three algorithms that dispatch the trucks, subject to minimizing their CO2 emissions. Finally, we give one algorithm that allocates fairly garbage costs to households. Our algorithms provide a stepping stone for further research in the future.}
